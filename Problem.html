        <h1>The Problem</h1>

        <h3>The world generates enough food to feed the entire world's population 1.5 times, which is enough
            to feed over 10 BILLION people, yet 8.9% of the world's
            population goes to bed every night with an empty stomach.

             <h2>Food Waste Statistics</h2>
             <p>
                 One third of the food produced ends up in landfills. That's 1.3 billion metric tons every year.
                 <br><br>
                 The total cost of food waste is estimated to be $1 trillion every year (including seafood).
                 <br><br>
                 If food waste was a country, it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas producer; it is estimated
                 that 3.3 billion tons of CO2 every year (about 1,000 tons of CO2 per minute).

             <h2>Food Waste is Just the Tip of the Iceberg</h2>
             <p>
                 About 690 million people around the world are starving, and they don't have access to proper food yet
                 perfectly good food is wasted. This is simply unacceptable.
                 <br><br>
                 If even one-fourth of the food that was wasted is recovered, it would be enough to feed all the world's
                 hungry.
                 <br><br>
                 Problems such as this won't go away by itself. People with leftovers, overcrowded fridges, and dinner
                 plates filled to the brim need to be aware of what is going on.

			<h1 class="gradient-text">Overview</h1>

			<p class="solutionp">
				It is statically proven that people will fill up any white-space in their fridge with food
				regardless of them using it. Because people tend to forget about the food in the back of their fridge,
				this app will help do the remembering for them!
			</p>

			<br>

			<h1 class="gradient-text">Specifics</h1>

			<p class="solutionp">

				This app will record the date that the food was initially put in the fridge. Then, it will pull information, from a database,
				about the food's expiry date and how long it can be used past the expiry date. This will be displayed in the "Stored food"
				section of the app.

			</p>

			<p class="solutionp">

				In order for the app to recognize the food that is in the fridge, all you need to do is take a picture of the
				barcode on the product. The app will send you notifications about foods that you may have forgotten about or
				may expire soon.

			</p>

			<br>

			<h1 class="gradient-text">Possible Future Changes</h1>

			<p class="solutionp">

				Maybe in the future, the app won't be necessary; the fridge could have a system in it that could display a
				notification about foods that you haven't used or may expire in the new future.

				There can be more than one solution for a problem. And the answer to the food waste conundrum is simply to
				spread awareness. People around the world don't have proper storage or distribution buildings to keep the food fresh
				and give the extra to those in need. If you are a person at home and wants to help by saving food, 
				visit  <a href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/reduce-food-waste#TOC_TITLE_HDR_4" class="green" target="_blank">this site</a>
			</p>

			<br>

			<p class="solutionp">
				Food waste can be reduced easily. 46% of the world's food waste happens during consumption and distribution.
				This means that if all the food that was distributed was used up correctly, it would reduce the total food waste by
				more than 11%.
			</p>

			<br>

			<p class="solutionp">
				If we start solving food waste community wide and then scale it up to city, then state, then country, and
				eventually the world, there will be no hunger at all! As a bonus, it will help counter climate change. We just need
				to fix storage warehouses to keep the food from rotting, then its just distributing to those in need.

        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <img src="assets/My_Face.png" alt="" class="resize3">

        <p>
            My name is Atharv and I am 16 years old, and I live in Fremont, CA. During my Freshman year at American High School,
            I became interested in computer programming, so I started learning Python. It was fun, and I made small programs
            such as Hangman and a number guessing game.
            Aside from programming, I enjoy playing soccer and badminton.

            Anyway, enough about me. Check out how this website was made.

        <h1 class="green">My Train of Thought</h1>

        <br>

        <p class="solutionp">
            The prompt given was "Solve a World Problem." The first thoughts that came to mind was 'global warming' and
            'poverty.' These problems would be hard to solve with a computer program, so I researched about other
            problems out there and
            found out that Food Waste was a big problem. I knew that world hunger and garbage was a
            big problem. I felt bad about it but as time passed, I got involved with other things and slowly forgot about
            it.

        </p>

        <p class="solutionp">

            A feeling of guilt seized me, and I decided that I would make an awareness website about this topic.

        </p>

        <h1 class="green">Inspiration</h1>

        <p class="solutionp">

            As I searched for statistics, I stumbled upon this video by Vox (it's below). The ideas and information in the video boosted
            my confidence,and I decided to make a <a href="https://www.justinmind.com/usernote/tests/66889101/66889403/66905879/index.html" class="green" target="_blank">prototype of an app</a> that would prevent
            waste at home.

        <h1 class="gradient-text">Special Thanks</h1>

        <p class="solutionp">

            I would like to thank the entire <a href="https://www.terrischallenge.info/#" class="green" target="_blank">Terris Challenge</a>
            team for hosting this challenge. It prompted me to do something that I wouldn't do on my own. Because of this
            kick-start, I will continue building upon this website, the app, and other programs. Thanks!!!

        <h1>Stop Food Waste!</h1>

        planet."</p>

        <p>
            As of now, this place is an awareness website. Many people don't know the big impact food waste is making.
            I also was oblivious to the statistics but as I searched about it more, I started to realize that we just look over
            the food that we waste.

        <h1 class="green">Future Plans</h1>

        <p>
            This website will be more than just an awareness site. I want to continue on and make this a place where people
            can donate food and other people can accept that food. I also want to spread the statistics that I was oblivious to, so
            people can do something about it. There will also be a blog page where people can share their thoughts and come up
            with ideas that can remove the impediment called food waste.
